Resources for my talk at Data Con LA 2023: "Predicting Purchases, Rare Diseases, and More: Using Ordinal Regression to Estimate Rare Event Probabilities"

* The file **pres_figs.R** contains the R code that generates the figures in slides 7 - 13. (It will automatically load needed functions from the file **model_functions.R**. You do not need to run this code manually, just make sure both of these files are in the same folder on your computer.)
* The file **proportional_odds_code.R** contains the R code from slides 21 - 27 that train a proprtional odds model on the soup data set. It also contains the example code from slide 24 that demonstrates how to create an ordered categorical variable in R.
